Step by step how to calculate HR from Analog:

1. [X] get_raw_AD(): Red the analog signal from the ADC, take 5 running average of the raw AD values
2. [X] find_threshold(): Calculate min, max of filtered signal, find threshold (80%)
3. [X] find_peak(): Find peaks that go over threshold 
4. [X] calculate_bpm(): From peaks, find PPI and BPM
5. [X] find_averageHR(): Calculate an average of every 5 heart rates, display to the screen


Formulas:

PPI: Peak-to-peak indexes, so it equals to number of peaks - 1
PPI: Number of samples between the peaks. Therefore, you need to convert it to ms (multiple with f = 1/ ...Hz to calculate PPI)
BPM: 60s * 1000ms / ppi
SDNN: 
    1. Calculate the mean of peak-to-peak-intervals (PPIs)
    2. Subtract the mean PPIs from each individual PPI, square the result, and sum up all the squared deviations
    3. Calculate the variance: Take the above squared deviations (2), divide by the total number of PPIs
    4. Calculate the standard deviation: take the square root of variance (3)
RMSSD:
    1. Calculate the differences between adjacent PPIs
    2. Square each difference of (1)
    3. Calculate the mean of the squared differences from (2)
    4. Take the square root of the mean from (3) = RMSSD
