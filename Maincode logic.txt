Maincode logic:
- Welcome screen (3s)
- Menu screen display:
	+ Options selection ( using 1 variable = selected_index to control following selected option)
		+ if selected_index = 0 and encoder pressed : Heartrate measure
		+ if selected_index = 1 and encoder pressed : Basic measure
		+ if selected_index = 2 and encoder pressed : Kubios 
		+ if selected_index = 3 and encoder pressed : History
[]Heartrate measure algorithm
[]Basic measure algorithm + MQTT sender + update History
[x]Kubios (need to be tested)
[x]History ( need to be update when have new data, bug: end the program after running instead of staying in main loop)
[]Build the interupt for SW_0 button to go back to the menu when press ( idea is using a boolean and  an interupt to control )
[x] Clean unnnecessary codes 

Problems:
Update when have the Heartbeat
Program is now one direction => build up both ways
loops for mainprogram
Some of display problems
